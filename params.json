{"name":"Madeleine.js","tagline":"Pure javaScript 3D Model Viewer (.STL Format)","body":"# Madeleine.js\r\n\r\nMadeleine.js is a 3D Model parser & renderer for STL files (ASCII and binary both). \r\n\r\nMadeleine.js uses [Three.js](http://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) as its 3D Engine, and was inspired by the demo code of [tonylukasavage](https://github.com/tonylukasavage/jsstl).\r\n\r\nMadeleine.js is smart enough to distinguish whether stl files are ASCII or binary, and is able to create and handle multiple 3D model viewers (WARNING: Multiple rendering may slow down the speed). Also, Madeleine.js helps you to immediately render any stl file as you upload!\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n- Parse, render and visualize STL format files.\r\n- Automatically distinguish binary and ASCII, and parse it properly.\r\n- Accept STL file from external url or user file upload.\r\n- Support rendering multiple models (also multi upload).\r\n- Provide various themes for model viewer.\r\n- Allow user to interact with the model via mouse actions.\r\n- Support capturing the rendered 3D model (Implementing)\r\n- Support downloading the original stl file (Implementing)\r\n- Support different viewpoint (Implementing)\r\n- Support fullscreen mode (Implementing)\r\n- And more features will be added later!\r\n\r\n\r\n## DEMO\r\n\r\nVisit [DEMO Website](http://jinjunho.github.io/Madeleine.js/) to see the demo!\r\n\r\nFor developers, [download](https://github.com/JinJunho/Madeleine.js/archive/master.zip) or clone this repository and locate it on your web server root. You can check working demo by visiting **repo/examples/index.html** from your browser. Download any stl file and see how well it works!\r\n\r\n## Getting Started \r\n\r\nFirst, include resources into <head> element of your code.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<link href=\"src/css/Madeleine.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\r\n<script src=\"src/lib/stats.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"src/lib/detector.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"src/lib/three.min.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"src/Madeleine.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 1. Immediate File Upload\r\n\r\nAll you need to do is simply asking Lily (is Madeleine's sister) to get ready for file upload. She will take care of taking files, parsing, rendering and visualizing them.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<form id=\"myForm\" name=\"myForm\">\r\n    <input type=\"file\" id=\"myForm\" name=\"myForm\" multiple>\r\n</form>\r\n<div id=\"target\"></div>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nwindow.onload = function(){\r\n    Lily.ready({\r\n        target: 'target'  // target div id\r\n        file: 'files',  // file input id\r\n    });\r\n}; \r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Render from file path\r\n\r\nIf you know the url or path to the stl file, call Madeleine directly with target div id and the file path.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div id=\"target\" class=\"madeleine\"></div>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nwindow.onload = function(){\r\n    var madeleine = new Madeleine({\r\n      target: 'target', // target div id\r\n      data: 'path/to/file.stl' // data path\r\n    });\r\n}; \r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis code is under [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/). You can do anything you want with my code, as long as you leave the attribution. It will be grateful if you contact me for interesting ideas to do with Madeleine.js. I'm willing to co-work with you!\r\n\r\n## Who am I?\r\n\r\nMy name is [Junho Jin](http://plrg.kaist.ac.kr/jjh) and I'm a newbie programmer :)\r\n\r\n## Who are Madeleine and Lily?\r\n\r\n[Lily and Madeleine](http://lilandmad.com) are one of my favourite singers. As a fan, I named this project after their names (hope they know it!).\r\n\r\nThis is my fuel for developing this project :)\r\n\r\n[![Lily and Madeleine - Fumes](http://img.youtube.com/vi/hZIci_KmtbY/0.jpg)](http://youtu.be/hZIci_KmtbY)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
